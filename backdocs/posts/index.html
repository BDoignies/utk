			<h2> Uni{corn|form} Tool Kit </h2>
			
			<p>
			The UTK tool kit aims at providing executables to generate
			and analyze point set. It is originally meant to help researchers
			developing sampling patterns in a numerical integration using Monte Carlo estimators.
			More precisely, it was developped with the precise question of
			optimizing image synthesis via Path tracing algorithms.
			</p>
			
			<h1>Clone and Build</h1>
			
			<p>UTK is hosted on a git repository.
			To install it, the first step is to clone the repository on your computer.
			This can be done using the following command line:
			<pre><cli>
git clone https://github.com/utk-team/utk.git
			</cli></pre>
			</p>
			
			<p>The code can be build on a Linux or a Mac environement.
			The Windows build is not yet supported.
			To build it, one can use the following commands,
			assumming the current working directory is the cloned
			utk repository.
			<pre><cli>
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
			</cli></pre>
			</p>
			
			<h1>External libraries</h1>
			
			The UTK repository provides the files for two external libraries:
			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://cimg.eu">CImg</a>(for image processing)
				<li><a href="https://zigasajovic.github.io/dCpp/">dCpp</a> (for automatic differentiation).
			</ul>
			
			It may also require several other librairies, namely:
			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://cgal.org">CGAL</a> (to generate analytical shapes arrangements)
				<li><a href="http://fftw.org">FFTW3</a> (to compute Fourier spectras)
			</ul>
			
			<p>Finally, it also strongly relies on the Gnuplot framework to generate
			graphs.</p>
			
			<p>Note that none of those libraries are mandatory. When building the UTK framework, 
			the external dependancies can be either activated or deactivated.
			Each tool of this framework is compiled independentely. 
			If a dependancy is marked as unrequired, all the tools that do not require
			this dependancy are still compiled.</p>
			
			<p>Originally, only CImg and dCpp are activated, since they are very light libraries
			and are provided with the framework.</p>
			
			<p>
			To activate or deactivate a library, one can either edit the file
<name>utk/CMakeLists.txt</name>
			to set to true/false the variables [LIBRARY]_ON.
			Or one can use the following command 
			<name>ccmake ..</name> from the build repository to edit the compilation options.
			</p>
